      <description><![CDATA[Join Microsoft MVP & DevExpress Technical Evangelist Paul Usher, as he takes a look at the state of play for desktop development. During this frank session you will see where technologies like Electron fit into the picture, which technology should you reach for when starting a new desktop project? WinForms? WPF? Electron?  Should you be targeting xplat? Is .NET Core the next big thing? Can devices like the Raspberry Pi replace some desktop functionality? It’s set to spark some interesting discussions and is one meeting not to be missed! (evening proudly sponsored by DevExpress)

      <description><![CDATA[Deploying Enterprise Applications can be an art unto itself. Sophisticated, distributed systems often have a lot of moving parts. Databases often need to be updated with schema changes and new reference data with each new release.

Octopus Deploy takes a lot of the heavy lifting out of complex deployments. Being an automated process, it removes opportunities for human error to occur during a deployment. It also integrates well with Continuous Integration servers, resulting in end-to-end automation from code commits to deployment of compiled code.

In this presentation, we'll take a look at the basics of Octopus Deploy and see how it can significantly free up developers to focus on actual development, rather than having to also worry about the deployment aspects as well.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In this presentation we’ll take a look at virtual reality technology with a focus on how to develop software using the .net stack. We’ll look back at the early days of the technology and some of the impressive accomplishments and failures of those attempts at creating virtual reality. We’ll then fast forward twenty years to review the current state of the art and some of the exciting recent developments.

Knowing where we currently stand with the hardware we’ll delve into how to write software for virtual reality using .NET. We’ll take a look at the tools used and the familiar (and not so familiar) programming principles required when developing for virtual reality.

The presentation will include code examples and of course there will be an Oculus Rift on standby with several VR applications from Novus Res ready to be experienced.
