      <description><![CDATA[Deploying Enterprise Applications can be an art unto itself. Sophisticated, distributed systems often have a lot of moving parts. Databases often need to be updated with schema changes and new reference data with each new release.

Octopus Deploy takes a lot of the heavy lifting out of complex deployments. Being an automated process, it removes opportunities for human error to occur during a deployment. It also integrates well with Continuous Integration servers, resulting in end-to-end automation from code commits to deployment of compiled code.

In this presentation, we'll take a look at the basics of Octopus Deploy and see how it can significantly free up developers to focus on actual development, rather than having to also worry about the deployment aspects as well.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In this presentation we’ll take a look at virtual reality technology with a focus on how to develop software using the .net stack. We’ll look back at the early days of the technology and some of the impressive accomplishments and failures of those attempts at creating virtual reality. We’ll then fast forward twenty years to review the current state of the art and some of the exciting recent developments.

Knowing where we currently stand with the hardware we’ll delve into how to write software for virtual reality using .NET. We’ll take a look at the tools used and the familiar (and not so familiar) programming principles required when developing for virtual reality.

The presentation will include code examples and of course there will be an Oculus Rift on standby with several VR applications from Novus Res ready to be experienced.

      <description><![CDATA[Buddy IoT Platform 
Buddy is a cloud platform for Internet of Things (IoT). Using Buddy, you can collect all of your device data with a single, clean API and send it to any analytics, marketing or visualization tool or service.

In this presentation, Habib Heydarian will provide an overview of the Buddy platform, explain how to use the Buddy API to build Internet of Things applications and describe the features & capabilities of the platform.

Web Accessibility

Accessibility is something we should all care about. Even if it doesn't affect you individually now, chances are you know someone who does (or even yourself as we all get older and our senses become less effective than they used to be) having accessible software becomes essential.

Cliff Edwards give a practical overview of making the web more accessible. He debunks common myths, highlights pitfalls and demonstrates tools and techniques to make the web a more accessible place for everyone. ]]></description>
